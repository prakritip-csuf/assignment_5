## Assignment 5: Physical Simulation

Name of Student: Prakriti Paudel

Collaboration: I did not collaborate with anyone in the class directly for this assignment. However, I reached out on Discord to get some help regarding cloth faces and received a helpful response.

References: Several refrences were helpful throughout the assignment.

- Professor's Documentation: The course material and the pdf for assignment instruction was useful for understanding aspects of cloth simulation.
- Development Session: The development session was really helpful to execute Euler integration and other concepts as well like Springs for Simple Cloth.
- YouTube videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ansULG6650A I was stuck in one part because my cloth was not rendering, so this video gave me some idea on how to handle that.

Known Problems: At the moment, I don't think there are any issues with my code. It functions as intended, and I was able to complete some extra credit section with success. The Cloth simulation is performing as expected, and the wind force is applied appropriately when the enable wind toggle is on. 

Additional Comments:
This assignment was challenging but I enjoyed doing it than other previous assignments. It pushed me to learn more about physics-based simulations like gravity and drag. 

The requirements were generally clear, although some areas, especially cloth rendering, were more difficult than expected. Initially, I found the cloth simulation to be quite complex, but once I understood the underlying mechanics, the process became much more manageable.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project.
